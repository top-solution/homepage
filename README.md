## 🚀 Quick start

1. **Start developing.**

   ```sh
   npm install
   npm run dev #watch svelte files and build when any of them change
   npm start #start a simple web server on public directory
   ```

2. **Create a new component**

   To implement a new component you need to create a `.svelte` file. Don't forget to include the necessary tag at line 1 of the file:

   ```html
   <svelte:options tag="svelte-component" />
   ```

   You need to import the common style in your component:

   ```css
   @import "css/main.css";
   @import "css/normalize.css";
   @import "css/style.css";
   ```

3. **Component style**

   Each component have his own style inside, not accessible from the outside. You can found the common css in the `css/style.css` file.
